        <p>Operating the airbrush.</p>

        <p>With a dual action-type airbrush, pushing the button will only spray air. You need to push the button and pull it back to spray both paint and air. The amount of paint coming out depends on how far you pull the button back.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pad_01.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>Push the button. If you push the airbrush button, air will come out.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pad_02.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>Pull back while pushing the button If you pull back while pushing the button, air and paint will jet out.</p>
      
        <StaticImage src="../../images/pad_03.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>Let go of the button When you need to stop painting, release your finger from the button.</p>

        <p>The needle can't move. What do I do?</p>
        <p>If you use an airbrush for an extended period of time, paint inside the airbrush can harden. This can interfere or even block the needle from moving. If this happens, take out the needle and clean it. This will solve most issues, but if even after repeated washes the situation doesn't improve then [contact your airbrush manufacturer's customer support for help.]</p>
        <p>Turn off the Compressor, and unscrew the needle cap.</p>
        <p>Pull the needle out of the airbrush, and wipe away any dried paint with a tissue soaked in thinner.</p>

        <p>What's a backflush?</p>
        <p>If you slightly loosen the airbrush's nozzle cap before spraying, air flows back into the cup. This is useful for agitating any wet paint in the cup or [for cleaning the inside of the cup with thinner]. </p>

        <p>How to backflush. Take off the airbrush cup's lid before backflushing.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pad_04.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>Loosen the nozzle cap, then push and pull the button back. Loosen the airbrush nozzle cap about 1 mm.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pad_05.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>Backflow air to the inside of the cup. This agitates the liquids inside the cup.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pad_06.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>Tighten the nozzle cap again.</p>

        <p>Be careful of spills! While backflushing, it's possible for paint or thinner to fly out of the cup. Prepare newspaper to avoid causing stains.</p>

        <p>Translator's Note: [Note: Traditionally, western models backflush by covering the nozzle up. Some people have also warned that backflushing can get paint into parts of your airbrush internals it shouldn't be, potentially forcing a more intense cleanup that could damage it over the years. Others have reported no problems, so it may depend on the brand.]</p>

        <p>Airbrushing practice.</p>
        <p>When airbrushing, there are three variables to keep in mind: distance from the target, quantity of paint, and air pressure. Understanding the effects of changing these variables will help you master airbrushing.</p>
        <p>[Let's warm up by practicing on some paper or spare runners.]</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pad_07.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>If you're too close, the paint will run. This makes it hard to paint properly.</p>
        
        <StaticImage src="../../images/pad_08.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        
        <p>If you're too far, the color will be too light. The finish will be gritty.</p>
        
        <StaticImage src="../../images/pad_09.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        
        <p>Aim for a reasonable distance, about 3-5 cm. It depends on the size of the part, but generally a distance of 3-5 cm is good.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pad_10.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>Tip: Keep your hand moving. [If you keep spraying your airbrush at a single point, the paint will run.] Always keep your hand in motion.</p>
     
        <p>In a dual action-type airbrush, how far you pull the button back controls how much paint comes out.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pad_11.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>Pulling back slightly. This sprays a small amount of paint, resulting in a thin coat. You'll need to be close to the target for the paint to show up.</p>
       
        <StaticImage src="../../images/pad_12.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>[Pulling back all the way.] This sprays a large amount of paint, resulting in a thick coat. [You should be 5 cm away from the target for a smooth finish.]</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pad_13.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>Get an intuitive understanding of the relation between paint quantity and distance. Practice on a sheet of paper.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pad_14.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>Alphabet practice. One way to practice is to spray the letters of the alphabet. [Try to keep the letters at a consistent thickness.]</p>

        <p>Needle Stopper If you're having trouble controlling how far back you pull the button, you can use the needle stopper at the back of the airbrush. It limits how far back you can pull the button, preventing you from overspraying.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pad_15.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>Spin the needle stopper to adjust. Spinning clockwise reduces how far back you can pull the button.</p>

        <p>Adjusting Air Pressure</p>
        
        <p>Use high pressure to paint large surfaces, and low pressure to paint small parts. Keep an eye on the regulator's pressure gauge as you adjust the pressure.</p>
        
        <StaticImage src="../../images/pad_18.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>If the air pressure is too high, the paint will run. You could blow the part away too.</p>
        
        <StaticImage src="../../images/pad_19.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        
        <p>If the air pressure is too low, not much paint will spray. You'll get a grittier finish, and it'll take longer to paint. [This can cause your paint to dry inside the airbrush.]</p>
        
        <StaticImage src="../../images/pad_16.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        
        <p>Spinning the knob at the top of the regulator will adjust how much air will flow through the hose to the airbrush. You can also use the air adjustment screw if your airbrush has one for more minute adjustments.</p>
        
        <StaticImage src="../../images/pad_20.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>Extract all of the air out of the air hose. After switching off the compressor, press the airbrush's button to let out all the air. If you leave the pressure to build up for long periods of times, it's easy to damage the hose. - You're fine once the pressure gauge's reading says 0.</p>
