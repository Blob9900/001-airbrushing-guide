        <h1 className="title has-text-centered">What do I need to start airbrushing?</h1>

        <p>The bare minimum airbrushing setup has an airbrush, an <b>air compressor</b>, and an <b>air hose</b>.</p>

        <div className="level-item py-3">
          <StaticImage className="box" src="../../images/pab_00.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        </div>

        <p>An air compressor is a device that provides your airbrush with the compressed air it needs to function. It's an indispensable piece of equipment for airbrushing, but can also be an expensive investment: the pictured Mr. Linear Compressor L5 by GSI Creos has a MSRP of 31,000 yen. If your budget is a problem, and you don't see yourself painting for long periods of time, you can substitute a compressor with cans of compressed air.</p>
        
        <div className="level-item py-3">
          <StaticImage className="box" src="../../images/pab_01.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        </div>
        
        <p>An air hose connects the airbrush to the compressor. The material of the tubing can vary, but what's important is the diameter. Most airbrushes have a thread size of 1/8" BSP, but compressors could be 1/8", 1/4", 3/8", 1/2" or 3/4". You may need to purchase an adapter for your hose so it can connect at both ends.</p>

        <div className="level-item py-3">
          <StaticImage className="box" src="../../images/pab_02.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        </div>

        <p>While not as <em>outright</em> essential, an <b>air regulator</b> is also important. It sits between the airbrush and the compressor, and serves three functions: decompression, draining, and forking.</p>
        
        <div className="level-item py-3">
          <StaticImage className="box" src="../../images/pab_03.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        </div>

        <p>When you turn a compressor on, it'll output air at a constant pressure. If this pressure is too high, you can use a regulator to decompress the air before it reaches the airbrush to something more suitable to work with.</p>
        
        <div className="level-item py-3">
          <StaticImage className="box" src="../../images/pab_04.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        </div>
        
        <p>The air a compressor outputs is drawn from the environment around it. If it's too humid, water droplets will be sent to your airbrush too, which can cause problems while painting. But if you have a regulator with a drain bottle, it'll trap that water.</p>
        
        <div className="level-item py-3">
          <StaticImage className="box" src="../../images/pab_05.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        </div>
        
        <p>Some regulators can serve as a splitter valve. So if you have two airbrushes, you could connect both of them to the same compressor.</p>

            <p><b>Translator's Note:</b> I don't recommend getting an air compressor from GSI Creos. The Mr. Linear Compressor line leaves out standard features like a built-in regulator or attached air tank because they're trying to be as compact as possible. This might be useful if you live in a small apartment like the stereotypical Japanese modeler, but otherwise they're arguably a waste of money compared to the compressors at your local hardware store. Especially if you need to get a voltage converter to use them safely. If you <em>must</em> use a Japanese brand, buy an Iwata.</p>

        <p>A <b>spray booth</b> is also very helpful to have. When you spray paint, by definition you're scattering fine mists of paint and thinner. Inhaling this is harmful to your lungs, and having it floating around could affect drying paint to boot. One way to deal with this is to work outside, but then you have to worry about the wind and rain. Another way is to use an airbrush spray booth like the pictured Mr. Super Booth by GSI Creos, which will suck up the floating paint or thinner particles and push them outside.</p>
        <p>If you don't have or can't afford a commercial spray booth, try making your own. Even just spraying your paint towards an open cardboard box can do a lot to prevent the spread of paint mist. But be sure to open a window to ventilate the area.</p>

        <div className="level-item py-3">
          <StaticImage className="box" src="../../images/pab_07.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        </div>

        <p>Stuff newspaper into a conveniently-sized cardboard box, and you'll make an impromptu basic spray booth.</p>

        <div className="level-item py-3">
          <StaticImage className="box" src="../../images/pab_08.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        </div>

        <p>And if you're comfortable with DIY projects, you can build a better spray booth by putting an off-the-shelf ventilation fan in a cardboard box.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The last requirement for airbrushing is the paint you'll be spraying. Hobby paints come in three types, each with its own thinner. Using the wrong thinner can cause your paint to not mix properly, so it's important to know which type of paint you're using.</p>

        <div className="level-item py-3">
          <StaticImage className="box" src="../../images/pab_09.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        </div>

        <p><b>Lacquer paints</b> are a solution of acrylic compounds and lacquer thinner. They dry fast and don't scratch easily, making them a popular choice for modelers. Though it's very volatile, so be sure to ventilate your painting area while painting or while the paint is drying.</p>
        <p>There are many brands, but Mr. Color by GSI Creos is the one mentioned in Gunpla manuals. This line has over 200 colors, and many variations like Gundam Color, Mr. Color GX, or Mr Metallic Color GX. In 2008, the Mr. Color line changed its packaging. You can see the old styling on the right.</p>

        <div className="level-item py-3">
          <StaticImage className="box" src="../../images/pab_10.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        </div>

        <p>This is Mr. Color's lacquer thinner, the simply-named Mr. Color Thinner. You can use it to thin lacquer paint, or quickly clean paintbrushes and airbrushes. It comes in 50, 110, 250, and 400 ml bottles. There's an improved variant called Mr. Color Leveling Thinner that includes an ingredient called retarder. This improves paint flow and slows down paint drying time, resulting in a smoother, glossier finish compared to the regular thinner. It comes in 110 and 400 ml bottles.</p>
        <p>There are additional variants called Mr. Color True Solvent and Mr. Tool Cleaner. True Solvent is used to restore paint that's dried out after being stored for too long, while Tool Cleaner is an even stronger thinner used for situations like paint that's hardened inside your airbrush.</p>

        <div className="level-item py-3">
          <StaticImage className="box" src="../../images/pab_11.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        </div>

        <p><b>Enamel paints</b> are oil-based, and take longer to dry than lacquer paints. But the paint flows well, making them great for handbrushing and pin washes. You need to use enamel thinner to thin enamel paint.</p>
        
        <div className="message my-3 is-light">
          <div className="message-body">
            <p><b>Translator's Note:</b> This next bit isn't directly related to airbrushing, but I think it's an important property of enamel paint to know about.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div className="level-item py-3">
          <StaticImage className="box" src="../../images/pab_24.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        </div>

        <p>Be careful not to break parts when using enamel solvent. Gunpla kits are snap-fit, which means that the parts rely on friction to stay together. This stresses the plastic at the points of connections, which can create invisibly small cracks. Enamel paint as previously mentioned flows well and takes a while to dry, so it can flow into and sit in these cracks, expanding them. This can results in parts cracking, crumbling, or even melting.</p> 

        <p>Because of this, I recommend disassembling your kit prior to doing pin washes with enamel paints. If that isn't feasible for your situation, at least try to disassemble parts under more strain than others like the joints.</p>

        <div className="level-item py-3">
          <StaticImage className="box" src="../../images/pab_25.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        </div>
 
        <p>Most gunpla kits use ABS (<b>a</b>crylonitrile <b>b</b>utadiene <b>s</b>tyrene) and/or PS (<b>p</b>oly<b>s</b>tyrene) plastic. All three kinds of paint thinners can weaken ABS, while PS is only particularly at risk with enamel thinner. You can check which kind of plastic is being used at the front of your kit's manual, or on the runners themselves. Look for the letters "ABS" or "PS".</p>

         <div className="level-item py-3">
          <StaticImage className="box" src="../../images/pab_12.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        </div>

        <p><b>Aqueous paints</b>, also referred to as just "acrylics", are a solution of acrylic compounds and water-based thinner. Compared to lacquer or enamel, they're much safer to use and even smell nicer. Since the thinner is water-based, you can use distilled water instead of a brand name thinner. Many aqueous paints have a matte appearance after drying, making them popular for military models.</p>

        <div className="level-item py-3">
          <StaticImage className="box" src="../../images/pab_13.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        </div>

        <p>GSI Creos sells their own line of aqueous paints. They're about the same as Tamiya's, and should not be confused with</p>

        <p>the newer Acrysion line. Compared to the previous two acrylics, it dries faster and sturdier. You can use water to thin/clean these paints while they're wet, but after they dry you'll need the brand name thinner. Note that Acrysion paint's can't be mixed with other lines of acrylic paint.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The different types of hobby paints have varying compatabilities with each other. Given paint types X and Y, painting X on top of Y might work fine but painting Y on top of X will lead to the base coat of X melting. In general:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can paint acrylics on top of lacquers or enamels, but not other acrylics.</li>
          <li>You can paint enamels on top of lacquer, but not acrylics or enamels.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Spare bottles</b> are used to store paint mixtures, custom or otherwise. You can write the names and ratios of the paints used on the labels. You can often find them in 18mL, 40mL, and 80mL sizes.</p>

        <p><b>Tissue paper</b> is useful for wiping up spilled or excess paint.</p>

        <p><b>Paper cups</b> can be used as a place to mix paints when there's too much for your paint dish to handle. Avoid plastic cups because the thinner might melt them.</p>

        <p><b>Face masks</b> are used to avoid inhaling the paint and thinner mist you're spraying. If you're bad with the smell of thinner, get a respirator mask and a filter set specialized for working with paint fumes.</p>

        <p><b>Gloves</b> are used to avoid getting paint on your hands and nails. I recommend disposable vinyl gloves you can get on the cheap.</p>
