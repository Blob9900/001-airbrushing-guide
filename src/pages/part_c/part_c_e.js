        <h1>Bonus: Masking.</h1>

        <p>Masking then painting color separation In cases where a single part has multiple colors on it, you can cover the spots you want to paint a different color [than the one you're currently using' with masking tape. In STEP5, I'll introduce tips for and the method of using masking tape.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_01.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>What's Masking? Masking has the meaning of "cover and hide". When you want to paint a single part multiple colors, use tape to protect the sections you don't want paint to get on during airbrushing to reproduce a part's color separation. There are many widths of masking tape, from mm to cm, but thin masking tape is easier to stick to curved surfaces, while wide masking tape is more convenient when you're roughly masking wider surfaces and the underside of parts. If you're able to precisely reproduce the color separation, then the level of completion rises considerably.</p>

        <p>Cut masking tape. Use a knife to cut masking tape into 2-3mm wide strips. Try not to leave jagged edges. Use tweezers to pick up the tape. Start from the edge of the tape and peel carefull to not rip the tape.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_05.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>Mask everything but the section you want to paint a different color. Affix masking tape on the part that's been painted primarily green. On the rims of the sections you want to paint a different color, tightly affix tape so that you don't create any gaps. - Do it so there's no gaps. - Cleanly affix it to the rim of the section you want to paint a different color.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_06.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>Firmly push down with your finger. So that the tape's edges don't stick up, firmly press down with your finger.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_07.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>Use a toothpick for thinner areas. As additional work on the tape edges, for thinner sections, press down with a toothpick.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_08.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>Airbrush. Use an airbrush to paint gray on the masked part.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_09.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_10.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>After painting, let the part dry for at least an hour, then carefully, slowly peel off the masking tape. When you're using tweezers, be careful not to damage the surface of the paint. If you roughly peel off the tape, the tape's adhesive surface might peel off some paint with it. - The masked sections are paint-free - Only the section you wanted to paint a different color has been painted.</p>

        <p>Painting the different colored sections first In cases when there's a section you want to paint a different color before painting the main body, let the section you painted first properly dry and then mask it. Here we'll paint the gray section first, then paint the primary green color.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_11.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>1. Paint gray with an airbrush. Start by airbrushing gray. After painting, let it dry for at least an hour.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_12.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>2. Mask the gray sections. Mask the gray sections. Use tweezers to affix the cut-up masking tape.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_13.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>3. Firmly push down on the tape. So that the tape's edges don't stick up, firmly press it down.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_14.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>4. Paint green with an airbrush. Airbrush the primary green color. Paint so that you cover up the overflowed gray paint. [the sections where the gray you sprayed on the thrusters got on the main green part] - When you're painting white or yellow, it can be hard to cleanly express the color due to the influence of the previously painted gray.</p>

        <p>5. Check that you painted uniformly. Check carefully to make sure there aren't any mistakes, then let it dry for at least an hour.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_15.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />
        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_16.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>6. Carefully peel off the tape. After painting, let the part dry for at least an hour, then carefully, slowly peel off the masking tape. When you're using tweezers, be careful not to damage the surface of the paint. If you roughly peel off the tape, the tape's adhesive surface might peel off some paint with it.</p>

        <p>Masking complex thin sections. In cases where it's not just a straight line, and you're masking thin, complex sections, use a knife to shape the masking tape.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_17.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>1. Affix masking tape to the part. Affix masking tape so that you cover up the entire part.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_18.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>2. Stick the tape so that air can't get in. Firmly stick the tape on with your fingers so that air can't get into a gap between the part and the tape.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_19.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>3. Use a toothpick to fit the tape to the part. Use a toothpick to fit the tape to the contours of the part.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_20.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>4. Be careful not to damage the tape. Fit the tape carefully so you don't damage the tape with the toothpick.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_21.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>5. Cut the tape with a knife. Using a blade with a swappable knife [make sure it's a new blade], cut the masking tape.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_22.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>6. Peel off the masking tape. Carefully peel off the masking tape you cut with a knife.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_23.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>This method is effective for large surfaces, but has trouble with small bits. As you can see, part of the detailing still needs to be masked.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_24.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>7. Affix thinly cut tape to sections you can't mask. For sections where when you cut with a knife you end up leaving gaps [as in, while you were cutting out the tape you cut too far and cut out an important section], for the insufficiently masked section, cover it up with thinly cut masking tape.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_25.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>8. Affix the thinly cut tape. Affix thinly cut masking tape to the rims of the patterns.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_26.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>9. Make the tape stick closer with a toothpick. If there's gaps in the tape, the paint could get in. So that the tape's edges and boundary lines don't float up, push down with a toothpick to make the tape stick.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_27.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>10. Airbrush white on the masked part.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_28.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>11. Carefully peel off the masking tape. After painting, let the part dry for at least an hour, then carefully, slowly peel off the masking tape. When you're using tweezers, be careful not to damage the surface of the paint. If you roughly peel off the tape, the tape's adhesive surface might peel off some paint with it.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pce_29.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>As careful as I was, there are still bits on this part where the paint bled through the masking tape. This is why you want to spend as much time as possible on the masking part.</p>

        <p>When you find an overflow when you peel off the masking tape, you can fix it with handbrushing. For small overflows, a simple fix will make it not stand out. The paint's overflowed here, but because you can correct it it's fine.</p>

        <p>Working Preparedness Tips In masking, affixing the tape isn't the goal, being able to precisely paint is!</p>
        <p>When you mask, there's an according increase in the amount of work you have to do, but while normally I'd recommend considering if you want to do the labor, for things like this time's subject kit "Kshatriya", if you precisely reproduce the color separation for the Sleeves patterns, then when you're done the showiness will go up considerably. For people who want to finish with paint and not seals, it's fine to challenge yourself. Let's aim to not have paint overflow, to precisely affix masking tape, and to paint color separation cleanly.</p>
