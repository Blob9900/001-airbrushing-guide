        <h1>Painting a part.</h1>
        <p>Now I'll introduce the basic painting process. You'll repeat a process of spraying paint and waiting for it to dry, building up thin layers of paint. Take care that the paint doesn't run.</p>
      
        <p>Before airbrushing, clean the inside of the cup. Clean the inside of the airbrush cup. Fill 1/3 of the cup with thinner, then backflush for about a minute. Afterwards, spray out the thinner and empty the insides of the airbrush cup. Go to page 44 for airbrush cleaning methods.</p>

        <p>if previously painted paint remains inside the airbrush then it could end up mixing colors, because of this backflush (see pg. 36) and clean the inside of the cup.</p>

        <p>Phase 1</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_02.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>1. Paint the rim. Dust the part, then start spraying the part's rim and panel limes. Distance should be about 3 cm away: if you're too close, the paint can run.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_03.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>2. Be careful with pointed edges. Paint is more likely to run here.</p>
	
        <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_04.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

      	<p>3. Paint any deep portions.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_05.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

	      <p>4. Build up color until it looks consistent. Keep spraying the rim and grooves until the color looks uniform.</p>
	
        <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_06.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

	      <p>[Wait 20 minutes for the paint to dry.] Phase 1 DONE!</p>

        <p>Phase 2:</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_07.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

        <p>1. Check the edges for any uncolored spots. And I don't mean just the edges of the rim, check the edges of any interior geometry too.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_08.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

	      <p>2. Check the grooves for any uncolored spots. Paint has a hard time sticking to panel lines and recessions too.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_23.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

      	<p>3. Spray the second coat. Spray as if you were expanding the lines you drew in the previous coat.</p>
	
        <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_24.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

      	<p>4. Flll in any uncolored spots you found in steps 1 and 2.</p>

        <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_25.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

      	<p>[Wait 20 minutes for the paint to dry.] Phase 2 DONE!</p>

      <p>Phase 3:</p>
	
      <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_09.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

      <p>1. Spray the third coat. Once again, spray as if you were expanding the lines of the previous coat. [Distance should be about 8 cm.] By the end of this phase, the whole surface should have at least some paint on.</p>
	
    	<p>[Wait 20 minutes for the paint to dry.]</p>
	
      <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_10.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

    	<p>2. Spray the fourth coat. Paint the entire part with the airbrush. Distance should be 5 cm away.</p>
	
      <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_11.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

	    <p>3. Even out the color.	You want the entire part to look a little glossy, and be a more consistent color.</p>
	
      <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_12.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

	    <p>[Wait 20 minutes for the paint to dry.] Phase 3 DONE!</p>

      <p>Phase 4:</p>
	
      <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_13.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

      <p>[1. Check for remaining uncolored or inconsistent spots.] Look at the part from multiple angles. This makes finding spots you missed easier.</p>
	
      <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_14.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

	    <p>[2. Spray the fifth coat.] Fill in any spots you found in step 1 [Distance is 10 cm away]. If you find you can't fill these spots, then wait for the new paint to dry again and try again.</p>
	
      <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_15.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

    	<p>3. Finish by spraying the entire part with paint. [Distance should be 10 cm away.] Then wait one hour for the paint to dry.</p>
	
      <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_16.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

	    <p>Phase 4 DONE!</p>

      <p>Building up thin layers of properly thinned paint results in an even coat and a beautiful, glossy finish.</p>

      <p>[Note: In general, paint from 5 cm away to lay initial color and 10 cm away for gaps and finishing touches.]</p>

      <p>When you're painting a color different from the base color, the color you're painting will be influenced by the base color. If the base color is dark, then if you want to paint bright colors like white or yellow on top of it, if necessary I recommend painting a base coat of base white.</p>

      <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_17.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

      <p>In order to cleanly produce color, paint a white basecoat. On the left is a part that was painted as is without a base coat. On the right is a part where red was painted on top of a basecoat of white. The difference in coloring is obvious.</p>

      <p>Base Coats When you want to paint a color different from the base color on top of the base color, I'll explain the tip of painting a base coat to minimize the effect of the base color. Since bright colors like white or yellow receive influence easily, in cases where you're painting on top of darker base colors you should spray a basecoat.</p>

      <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_19.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

      <p>The base color makes an influence and slight differences emerge in the expressing of color When you want to paint parts with a different base color the same color, it's possible that the base color makes an influence and slight differences emerge in the expressing of color. Like in the picture, if you paint with the base color as is, after painting the color could end up getting darker. If you painted with a base coat of white, they'd all be the same color, which is good.</p>

      <p>Process of painting a base coat So that the color won't receive influence from the base color and darken, paint a base coat with "Base White", a white paint used for base coats that has high "masking power", the power to hide away the base color.</p>

      <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_20.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

      <p>The white base coat material "base white" Compared to other paints, it has the characteristic of having a high "masking power".</p>      

      <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_21.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

      <p>Spray with an airbrush. Diluting to about 1 part paint to 3 parts thinner, spray with an airbrush.</p>

      <StaticImage src="../../images/pcb_22.jpg" placeholder="blurred" />

      <p>Check the condition of the color. Build up 3-4 coats, so that the white properly expresses it self.</p>
