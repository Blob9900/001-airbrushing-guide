        <p>After Shading After letting the paint used for shading dry for around an hour, check for completion. In cases where the shadow color is thin compared to other parts, or if you find spots you forgot to coat, then add more paint as a supplement.</p>

        <p>Check the whole body's balance Line up the fellow parts, and check the whole body's balance.</p>

        <p>Check the left/right conditions all at once. For the arm and leg parts, so that the left/right's shadow depths and the parts with shadow color inserted are identically balanced, check carefully.</p>

        <p>When you're building up coats of a semitransparent clear color, caution is essential The thigh area's shadow color, compared to other parts, ended up deeper. Beginning with Smoke Gray, when it comes to semitransparent clear color paints, caution is essential to make sure that building up coats doesn't make the color become deep. In cases where the color becomes deep, wipe it off with thinner and start over.</p>

        <p>The assembled condition was panel lined, had shading applied, resulting in its sense of solidity highlighted as a finishing touch. The multiple coats of Smoke Gray were adjusted depending on the color of the part, with the white parts having a light amount of shading, while the blue and gray parts had somewhat stronger shading, the shadow color with variations was something kept in mind.</p>
